@quotation Manifesto
On the internet there is a gigantic quantity of optical disc image
files in numerous formats.  Countless times we need to burn some of
them.  Some time ago I needed it, but I came across a file format
extremely irritating for a Free Software user like me: a CD layout
descriptor file, with @file{.ccd} suffix, generated by a proprietary
software called CloneCD.  I searched the internet for a way to burn
that file on the GNU+Linux-Libre system, but I only found a lot of
people asking for a solution on a lot of forums, and getting the
unanimous answer: no way!  At first I could not believe at that point
there was no option.  Then, with a little bit of patience and
research, I wrote some code to convert that files to a format much
more common and accessible, an ad-hoc standard in the GNU operating
system: the CUE sheet format.  So I could burn a lot of what I wanted!
I wondered whether it would be useful for others@dots{} and here is
the result!
@author Bruno Félix Rezende Ribeiro (oitofelix)
@end quotation
@end cartouche

The program GNU ccd2cue is a CCD sheet to CUE sheet converter.  It
supports the full extent of CUE sheet format expressiveness, including
mixed-mode discs and CD-Text meta-data.  It plays an important role
for those who need to use optical disc data which is only available in
the proprietary sheet format CCD, but don't want to surrender their
freedom.  It fills an important gap in the free software world because
before its conception it was impossible to use complex forms of
optical disc data laid out by CCD sheets in a whole/holy free
operating system.

@end multitable
@end ifhtml

The GNU ccd2cue documentation is also intended to be a reference
documentation for both sheet format specifications.  That way we can
reverse engineer the secret CCD sheet proprietary format only once and
then make the information available for developers in order to benefit
all free software users that want their software to be interoperable.
The CUE sheet format is not a secret, but with this project we take
the opportunity to ensure that its specification is available under a
free documentation license for the sake of the whole free software
community.

@c --- Distribution;
@ifnothtml
@chapter Distribution

This program is @dfn{free software}; this means that everyone is free
to use it and free to redistribute it under certain conditions.  This
program is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are
restrictions on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed
to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.
What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing
any version of this program that they might get from you.  The precise
conditions are found in the GNU General Public License (@file{COPYING}
file).  The program manual is covered by the GNU Free Documentation
License (@file{COPYING.DOC} file).  This license is similar in spirit
to the GNU General Public License, but is more suitable for
documentation.

@c --- Getting a copy;
@ifnothtml
@chapter Getting a copy

One way to get a copy of this program is from someone else who has it.
You need not ask for our permission to do so, or tell any one else;
just copy it.  You may also receive this program when you buy a
computer.  Computer manufacturers are free to distribute copies on the
same terms that apply to everyone else.  These terms require them to
give you the full sources, including whatever changes they may have
made, and to permit you to redistribute the program received from them
under the usual terms of the GNU General Public License.  In other
words, the program must be free for you when you get it, not just free
for the manufacturer.

If you have access to the Internet, you can get the latest
distribution version of this program at
@url{http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ccd2cue/}.  Please, use a mirror if
possible; you will be automatically redirected to the nearest mirror
at @url{http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/ccd2cue/}.

A CVS repository, where the development takes place, is also
available.  It maintains the full history of modifications of every
single source file.  You can checkout any given revision of any file
or get a snapshot of the entire source tree in a particular desired
state.  Special build tools, as described in @ref{Hacking}, are
required to build from those checkouts, though.  Notably, to stay up
to date with the latest developments in the source tree, you can
anonymously checkout the repository with the following command:
@example
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.savannah.nongnu.org:\
/sources/ccd2cue co ccd2cue
@end example
@end ifnothtml

@majorheading Download

@strong{The current stable release is @value{VERSION}} (released
@value{DATE}).  You can download it here:
@url{http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/ccd2cue/ccd2cue-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz,
ccd2cue-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz},
@url{http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/ccd2cue/ccd2cue-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz.sig,
ccd2cue-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz.sig} (alternative:
@url{http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ccd2cue/ccd2cue-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz,
ccd2cue-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz},
@url{http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ccd2cue/ccd2cue-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz.sig,
ccd2cue-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz.sig}).

You can find that and earlier releases at a nearby
@url{http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/ccd2cue/, GNU@tie{}ftp@tie{}mirror}; or
if automatic redirection does not work use the
@url{http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ccd2cue/,
GNU@tie{}main@tie{}ftp@tie{}server}.

This release is signed by @emph{Bruno Félix Rezende Ribeiro}.  His key
ID is @code{0x28D618AF}.  You can retrieve that key from a key server
using the command
@example
gpg --recv-keys 0x28D618AF
@end example

Check the key's authenticity with the command
@example
gpg --fingerprint 0x28D618AF | sed -n '/^[[:blank:]]\+Key/s/^.*= //p'
@end example

It must print the following fingerprint:
@example
7CB1 208C 7336 56B7 5962  2500 27B9 C6FD 28D6 18AF
@end example

Otherwise something is wrong!  In that case don't use the downloaded
tarball and contact the developers as described in @ref{Contact}.

A CVS repository, where the development takes place, is also
available.  To stay up to date with the latest developments in the
source tree, you can anonymously checkout the repository with the
following command:
@example
cvs -z9 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/ccd2cue co ccd2cue
@end example
@end ifhtml

@dualSection Bug reporting

If you come across some problem and need help you can contact the
community as described in @ref{Contact}.  If you think you found a
bug, but is not quite sure about it, you can instead ask for support
on our @url{https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?group=ccd2cue, support
tracker}.  We will revise your post, advise you and take the
appropriate measures.  If you are confident you have found a bug, you
can submit a bug report directly at our
@url{https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=ccd2cue, bug tracker}.
Please, when reporting a bug include enough information for the
maintainers to reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:

@itemize
@item
The contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug and
command line invocations of the program(s) involved (crucial!).
@item
A description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
@item
The version number of the program(s) involved (use
@option{--version}).
@item
Hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (@code{uname -a}).
@item
Unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see
@file{config.status}).
@item
Anything else that you think would be helpful.

@dualSection Contributing

This program is a collaborative project and we encourage contributions
from anyone and everyone --- your help is very much appreciated.  You
can help in many ways:

@itemize
@item
Donate to developers in order to support their work.  See
@ref{Donating}.
@item
Write documentation.  We are specially in need to complete the CCD
sheet format specification.
@item
Help users in the mailing list and IRC channel.
@item
Find and report bugs.  @xref{Bug reporting}.
@item
Fix reported bugs.
@item
Implement new feature ideas.
@item
Write test cases.
@item
Check the documentation against the implementation.
@item
Translate the program strings to other languages.
@end itemize

You can join the development team to contribute code and documentation
at the @url{https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/ccd2cue/, development
page}.  Patches are most welcome, but contributed code should follow
the @ref{,,, standards, GNU Coding Standards}.  If it doesn't, we'll
need to find someone to fix the code before we can use it.  It is also
necessary that the contributor be willing to assign their copyright to
the FSF, since the developers plan to make it officially part of the
GNU operating system and they want FSF to enforce the program's
license.  To get started hacking see @inlinefmtifelse{html,
@url{README.html#Hacking, how to hack}, @ref{Hacking}}.





@dualSection Donating

@c --- Hacking;
@dualSection Hacking

@noindent
The development sources are available through CVS at Savannah:

@display
https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=ccd2cue
@end display

If you are getting the sources from CVS (or change
@file{configure.ac}), you'll need to have Automake, Autoconf and
Gettext installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.  All of
these programs are available from @url{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/}.

After getting the CVS sources, and installing the tools above, you can
run @code{./bootstrap} to do a fresh build.  After that first time,
running @command{make} should suffice.  See file @file{INSTALL}.

When modifying the sources, or making a distribution, more is needed,
as follows:

@itemize
@item
This distribution also uses @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib,
Gnulib} to share common files, stored as a submodule in git.
@item
When updating gettext, besides the normal installation on the system,
it is necessary to run @code{gettextize -f} in this hierarchy to
update the @file{po/} infrastructure.  After doing so, rerun
@code{gnulib-tool --import} since otherwise older files will have been
imported.  @xref{,,, gnulib, Gnulib Manual}, for more information.
