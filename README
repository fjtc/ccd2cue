Bug reports:
 Please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the
 problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug
  and command line invocations of the program(s) involved (crucial!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
- unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see config.status).
- anything else that you think would be helpful.

Patches are most welcome;

See README-hacking for information on the development environment -- any
interested parties are welcome.  If you're a programmer and wish to
contribute, this should get you started.  If you're not a programmer,
your help in writing test cases, checking the documentation against the
implementation, translating the program strings to other languages,
etc., would still be very much appreciated.

Please see the AUTHORS and ChangeLog files for contributors and changes.

ccd2cue is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
