@itemize
@item
Support for all features of the CUE sheet format, prominently CD-Text
meta-data and track sub-code flags.
@item
Internationalization support using gettext.
@item
Compliance with the GNU Coding Standards and the GNU Maintaining
Standards.  @xref{,,, standards, GNU Coding Standards}.  @xref{,,,
maintain, GNU Maintaining Standards}.  Noteworthy changes are the use
of the GNU build system for the ease and consistency of build and
installation (see @file{INSTALL} file), documentation in the Texinfo
format, notably an user manual that can be outputted in numerous
formats including, but not limited to, printable pdf, info, html and
plain text.  @xref{,,, ccd2cue, The ccd2cue Manual}.
@item
Traditional Unix man page automatically generated by
@command{help2man}.
@item
Doxygen for in-depth source code documentation. That can be used to
output pdf, html and numerous other formats documenting the inner
workings of the code.
@item
GNU compliant command line parsing provided by Argp.  It is no more
necessary to provide arguments in the fixed order of command's
synopsis; the arguments can be given in any order and long options are
accepted.
@item
The command line options suffered the following changes to comply with
GNU Coding Standards:
@table @option
@item -o
Has companion long option @option{--output}.
@item -i
Has companion long option @option{--image}.
@item -h
Changed to @option{-?} with companion long option @option{--help}.
@item -v
Changed to @option{-V} with companion long option @option{--version}.
@end table

The following command line options were added to cover new features:
@table @option
@item -c @file{@var{cdt-file}}
@itemx --cd-text=@file{@var{cdt-file}}
Writes CD-Text data to @file{@var{cdt-file}}.
@item -a
@itemx --absolute-file-name
Uses absolute file name deduction.
@item --usage
Gives a short usage message.
@end table

@item
It is no longer required to specify @option{-i} option in every
invocation.  It is enough to specify only one file name on the command
invocation, as an option or non-option argument, since the remaining
needed file names are now deduced automatically.
