@quotation Manifesto
On the internet there is a gigantic quantity of optical disc image
files in numerous formats.  Countless times we need to burn some of
them.  Some time ago I needed it, but I came across a file format
extremely irritating for a Free Software user like me: a CD layout
descriptor file, with @file{.ccd} suffix, generated by a proprietary
software called CloneCD.  I searched the internet for a way to burn
that file on the GNU+Linux-Libre system, but I only found a lot of
people asking for a solution on a lot of forums, and getting the
unanimous answer: no way!  At first I could not believe at that point
there was no option.  Then, with a little bit of patience and
research, I wrote some code to convert that files to a format much
more common and accessible, an ad-hoc standard in the GNU operating
system: the CUE sheet format.  So I could burn a lot of what I wanted!
I wondered whether it would be useful for others@dots{} and here is
the result!
