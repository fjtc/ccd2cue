This @inlineifset{manual, chapter}@inlineifset{file,
file}@inlineifset{homepage, page} contains a list of people that
reported problems, suggested improvements or submitted relatively
small portions of actual code.  This program would not be what it is
today without the invaluable help of these people, to whom we would
like to say:

@center @strong{THANK YOU!}
