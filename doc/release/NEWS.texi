@table @asis
@item @value{version}
@include latest-news.texi
@item 0.4
@itemize
@item
The code repository moved from CVS to Git.
@item
Mailing lists were re-purposed.  Now @email{@value{mailBugAddr}} is
exclusively used for bug reporting and @email{@value{mailHelpAddr}} for
user support.
@item
Fixed bad wording in @option{--help} text.  Bug reported by Benno
Schulenberg of the Translation Project.
@item
Fixed potential crash caused by calling @code{error} function with wrong
arguments inside error handling routines.  Bug first noticed by Rosa
(GNU/)Linux maintainers.
@item
Fixed documentation distribution bug in which the @file{INSTALL} file
didn't get redistributed.  Bug reported by Darren S..
@item
Added @code{distgnu} Make target which aids the maintainer in uploading
release tarballs to the GNU ftp site.  It only can be made from VCS
checkouts.
@item
Likewise, the @code{homepage} Make target now can only be made from VCS
checkouts.  Therefore the exclusive infrastructure for building the
package's homepage doesn't get distributed.
@item
Fixed build system bug in which @command{configure} didn't detect the
absence of @command{help2man} for maintainer builds.
@item
Improved @code{maintainer-clean} Make target effectiveness.
@end itemize
@item 0.3
@itemize
@item
The program ccd2cue has become a GNU package, and therefore is now
dubbed GNU ccd2cue.  Its code and documentation have been updated to
reflect such remarkable occurrence.
@item
The target @code{homepage} generates the package homepage primarily
from release documentation.
@item
Some interesting GNU philosophy essays were added to documentation.
@item
Various bugs in the program and documentation were fixed.
@end itemize
@item 0.2
@itemize
@item
Support for all features of the CUE sheet format, prominently CD-Text
meta-data and track sub-code flags.
@item
Internationalization support using gettext.
@item
Compliance with the GNU Coding Standards and the GNU Maintaining
Standards.  See @ref{,,, standards, GNU Coding Standards} and @ref{,,,
maintain, GNU Maintaining Standards}.  Noteworthy changes are the use
of the GNU build system for the ease and consistency of build and
installation (see @file{INSTALL} file), documentation in the Texinfo
format, notably an user manual that can be outputted in numerous
formats including, but not limited to, printable pdf, info, html and
plain text.
@item
Traditional Unix man page automatically generated by
@url{https://www.gnu.org/software/help2man, help2man}.
@item
Doxygen for in-depth source code documentation. That can be used to
output pdf, html and numerous other formats documenting the inner
workings of the code.
@item
GNU compliant command line parsing provided by Argp.  It is no more
necessary to provide arguments in the fixed order of command's
synopsis; the arguments can be given in any order and long options are
accepted.
@item
The command line options suffered the following changes to comply with
GNU Coding Standards:
@table @option
@item -o
Has companion long option @option{--output}.
@item -i
Has companion long option @option{--image}.
@item -h
Changed to @option{-?} with companion long option @option{--help}.
@item -v
Changed to @option{-V} with companion long option @option{--version}.
@end table

The following command line options were added to cover new features:
@table @option
@item -c @file{@var{cdt-file}}
@itemx --cd-text=@file{@var{cdt-file}}
Writes CD-Text data to @file{@var{cdt-file}}.
@item -a
@itemx --absolute-file-name
Uses absolute file name deduction.
@item --usage
Gives a short usage message.
@end table

@item
It is no longer required to specify @option{-i} option in every
invocation.  It is enough to specify only one file name on the command
invocation, as an option or non-option argument, since the remaining
needed file names are now deduced automatically.
