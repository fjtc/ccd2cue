@end ifset

This @inlineifset{manual, chapter}@inlineifset{file, file} briefly
explains for what this package is intended, gives relevant
considerations regarding dependencies, configuration, build,
installation and use, describes which are the rules for its
distribution, how to get a copy of it, how to contact the community,
how to fill bug reports, how to contribute to the package, how to make
donations to support its development and how to get started hacking
the code.  Bear in mind that instructions in this @inlineifset{manual,
chapter}@inlineifset{file, file} are package-specific; for general and
in-depth configuration, build and installation instructions refer to
the file @file{INSTALL} present in the top-level directory of the
source distribution.  If you have checked out the source tree from the
VCS repository see @ref{Hacking}.

@c --- file, manual: Distribution;
@ifclear homepage
@metaSection Distribution

This program is @dfn{free software}; this means that everyone is free
to use it and free to redistribute it under certain conditions.  This
program is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are
restrictions on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed
to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.
What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing
any version of this program that they might get from you.  The precise
conditions are found in the @inlineifset{file, GNU General Public
License (@file{COPYING} file)}@inlineifset{manual, GNU
@acronym{@url{@value{progLicenseURL}, GPL}, General Public Licence}}.
The program manual is covered by the @inlineifset{file, GNU Free
Documentation License (@file{GNU-FREE-DOCUMENTATION-LICENSE}
file)}@inlineifset{manual, GFDL (@ref{GNU Free Documentation
License})}.  This license is similar in spirit to the GNU General
Public License, but is more suitable for documentation.

@c --- file, manual: Getting a copy;
@ifclear homepage
@metaSection Getting a copy

One way to get a copy of this program is from someone else who has it.
You need not ask for our permission to do so, or tell any one else;
just copy it.  You may also receive this program when you buy a
computer.  Computer manufacturers are free to distribute copies on the
same terms that apply to everyone else.  These terms require them to
give you the full sources, including whatever changes they may have
made, and to permit you to redistribute the program received from them
under the usual terms of the GNU General Public License.  In other
words, the program must be free for you when you get it, not just free
for the manufacturer.

If you have access to the Internet, you can get the latest
distribution version of this program at @url{@value{ftpDir}}.  Please,
use a mirror if possible; you will be automatically redirected to the
nearest mirror at @url{@value{ftpMirrorDir}}.

A VCS repository, where the development takes place, is also
available.  It maintains the full history of modifications of every
single source file.  You can checkout any given revision of any file
or get a snapshot of the entire source tree in a particular desired
state.  Special build tools, as described in @ref{Hacking}, are
required to build from those checkouts, though.  Notably, to stay up
to date with the latest developments in the source tree, you can
anonymously checkout the repository with the following command:
@example
git clone @value{GITurl}
@end example
@end ifclear





@c --- homepage: Download;
@ifset homepage
@anchor{Download}
@majorheading Download

@strong{The current stable release is @value{version}} (released
@value{date}).

@noindent
Here are the compressed sources and a GPG detached signature:
@example
@value{ftpTarball}
@value{ftpTarSign}
@end example

@noindent
Use a mirror for higher download bandwidth:
@example
@value{ftpMirrorTarball}
@value{ftpMirrorTarSign}
@end example

You can find that and earlier releases at a nearby
@url{@value{ftpMirrorDir}, GNU@tie{}ftp@tie{}mirror}; or if automatic
redirection does not work use the @url{@value{ftpDir},
GNU@tie{}main@tie{}ftp@tie{}server}.

The oldest (non-GNU) releases are available from
@url{@value{ftpOldMirror}, Savannah mirror download area}
(alternatively @url{@value{ftpOld}, Savannah download area}).  They
are only of historical interest and are no longer supported.

Use a @file{.sig} file to verify that the corresponding file (without
the @file{.sig} suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both
the @file{.sig} file and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a
command like this:

@example
gpg --verify @value{tarSign}
@end example

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
then run this command to import it:

@example
gpg --recv-keys @value{keyID} --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net
@end example

@noindent
and rerun the @code{gpg --verify} command.

This release is signed by @emph{@value{signer}}.  His key fingerprint
is @code{@value{fingerprint}}.

Check the key's authenticity with the command
@example
gpg --fingerprint @value{keyID} | sed -n '/^[[:blank:]]\+Key/s/^.*= //p'
@end example

It must print the following fingerprint:
@example
@value{fingerprint}
@end example

Otherwise something is wrong!  In that case don't use the downloaded
tarball and contact the developers as described in @ref{Contact}.

A VCS repository, where the development takes place, is also
available.  To stay up to date with the latest developments in the
source tree, you can anonymously checkout the repository with the
following command:
@example
git clone @value{GITurl}
@end example
@end ifset

response from community, you can join us on our friendly IRC channel:
@samp{@value{IRCurl}}.





@c --- Bug reporting
@metaSection Bug reporting

If you came across some problem and need help you can contact the
community as described in @ref{Contact}.  If you think you found a bug,
but is not quite sure about it, you can ask for support sending a mail
to @email{@value{mailHelpAddr}}.  We will revise your post, advise you
and take the appropriate measures.  If you are confident you have found
a bug, you can submit a bug report directly to
@email{@value{mailBugAddr}}.  You can subscribe to this ccd2cue's bug
reporting mailing list at @url{@value{mailBugWeb}, its web interface}.
To see the collection of prior reported bugs, visit
@url{@value{mailBugArch}, its archive}.  Please, when reporting a bug
include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the problem.
Generally speaking, that means:

@itemize
@item
The contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug and
command line invocations of the program(s) involved (crucial!).
@item
A description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
@item
The version number of the program(s) involved (use
@option{--version}).
@item
Hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (@code{uname -a}).
@item
Unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see
@file{config.status}).
@item
Anything else that you think would be helpful.

@c --- Contributing
@metaSection Contributing

This program is a collaborative effort and we encourage contributions
from anyone and everyone --- your help is very much appreciated.  You
can help in many ways:

@itemize
@item
Donate to developers in order to support their work.  See
@ref{Donating}.
@item
Write documentation.  We are specially in need to complete the CCD
sheet format specification.
@item
Help users in the mailing list and IRC channel.
@item
Find and report bugs.  @xref{Bug reporting}.
@item
Fix reported bugs.
@item
Implement new feature ideas.
@item
Write test cases.
@item
Check the documentation against the implementation.
@item
Translate the program strings to other languages.
@end itemize

You can join the development team to contribute code and documentation
at the @url{@value{develPage}, development page}.  Patches are most
welcome, but contributed code should follow the @ref{,,, standards,
GNU Coding Standards}.  If it doesn't, we'll need to find someone to
fix the code before we can use it.  It is also necessary that the
contributor be willing to assign their copyright to the FSF, since the
developers plan to make it officially part of the GNU operating system
and they want FSF to enforce the program's license.  To get started
hacking see @inlinefmtifelse{html, @url{README.html#Hacking, how to
hack}, @ref{Hacking}}.





@c --- Donating;
@metaSection Donating

If you find this program useful, please @strong{send a donation} to
its developers to support their work.  If you use this program at your
workplace, please suggest that the company make a donation.  We
appreciate contributions of any size -- donations enable us to spend
more time working on this package, and help cover our infrastructure
expenses.

If you'd like to make a donation of any value, please send it to the
following Bitcoin address:

@example
@value{btcAddr}
@end example

Since we aren't a tax-exempt organization, we can't offer you a tax
deduction, but for all donations over 0.05@tie{}BTC, we'd be happy to
recognize your contribution on the @url{DONORS.html, donors@tie{}page}
and on @file{DONORS} file for the next release.

We are also happy to consider making particular improvements or
changes, or giving specific technical assistance, in return for a
substantial donation over 0.5@tie{}BTC.  If you would like to discuss
this possibility, write to me at @email{oitofelix@@gnu.org}.

Another possibility is to pay a software maintenance fee.  Again,
write to me about this at @email{oitofelix@@gnu.org} to discuss how
much you want to pay and how much maintenance we can offer in return.

@center @strong{Thanks for your support!}

@c --- Hacking;
@metaSection Hacking

@noindent
The development sources are available through VCS at Savannah:

@display
@value{GITsavannah}
@end display

If you are getting the sources from a VCS (or change
@file{configure.ac}), you'll need to have Automake, Autoconf and Gettext
installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.  All of these
programs are available from @url{@value{ftp}}.

After getting the VCS sources, and installing the tools above, you can
run @code{./bootstrap && ./configure && make} to do a fresh build.
After that first time, running @command{make} should suffice to rebuild
the program with your changes.  See file @file{INSTALL}.

When modifying the sources, or making a distribution, more is needed,
as follows:

@itemize
@item
This distribution also uses @url{https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib,
Gnulib} to share common files, stored as a submodule in git.
@item
When updating gettext, besides the normal installation on the system,
it is necessary to run @code{gettextize -f} in this hierarchy to
update the @file{po/} infrastructure.  After doing so, rerun
@code{gnulib-tool --import} since otherwise older files will have been
imported.  @xref{,,, gnulib, Gnulib Manual}, for more information.
@end itemize

When committing changes to the repository always create an entry in the
@file{doc/release/latest-news.texi} file for any user-visible changes or
additions made.  This file is intended to provide the latest release
news for the @file{NEWS.texi} and @file{ANNOUNCEMENT.texi} files to
avoid duplication of information and syncing work.  After a release is
made the news items should be moved to the @file{NEWS.texi} file and
another news list should be built from scratch in the
@file{ANNOUNCEMENT.texi} file.
