This @inlinefmtifelse{html, page, file} contains a list of people that
supported development by means of donation.  This program would not be
what it is today without the invaluable help of these people, for whom
we would like to say:

@center @strong{THANK YOU VERY MUCH!}
@sp 1

If you would appreciate your own name listed here, @strong{please
donate!}  See @inlinefmtifelse{html, @url{README.html#Donating, how to
donate}, the ``Donating'' section of the @file{README} file}.
