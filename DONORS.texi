This document contains a list of people that supported development by
means of donation.  This program would not be what it is today without
the invaluable help of these people, for whom we would like to say:

@center @strong{THANK YOU VERY MUCH!}

If you would appreciate your own name listed here, @strong{please
donate!}  See the ``Donating'' section of the @file{README} file.
