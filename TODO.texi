This document contains a list of ideas and features which would be
nice to see implemented some day.  If you are ready to start working
on any of these TODO items, we appreciate your help; please write to
@email{ccd2cue-bug@@nongnu.org} so we can be aware that the problem is
being addressed, and talk with you how to do it best.  It is best to
consult the latest version of this file in the program source code
repository.  See the sections ``Getting a copy'' and ``Hacking'' of
the file @file{README} for instruction on how to access it.

Since the developers of this program are willing to assign the
copyright of this package to FSF, please be prepared to sign legal
papers to transfer the copyright on your work to the FSF too.  For
more details on this, see the section ``Contributing'' in the file
@file{README}.  That file also contains some more practical details
about getting involved.

As well as the issues listed here, there are bug reports, which are
effectively to-do items too --- that can use your help --- at
@url{https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=ccd2cue} and the
@file{BUGS} file.  See the section ``Bug reporting'' in @file{README}
file for more information.





@c --- CCD sheet format specification;
@node CCD sheet format specification
@chapter CCD sheet format specification

There is a specification of the CCD sheet format in the program manual
at @ref{CCD sheet format,,, ccd2cue, The ccd2cue Manual}.  That
specification is the result of a reverse engineering process and is
incomplete; pretty much only the fields that affects the CUE sheet
generation are known.  It would be very nice to decipher the entirety
of the format, and document it, so we can bring into light whether
there is room for improvement in the conversion process, and to open
new possibilities for more expressive formats like the TOC sheet.





@c --- TOC sheet format;
@node TOC sheet format
@chapter TOC sheet format

As the name implies the program ccd2cue is designed to convert CCD
sheets only to the CUE sheet format.  This format has some well know
limitations regarding the sub-channel data, which apparently can be
mitigated by more expressive formats.  There is one sheet format
called ``TOC'' that is very common, well documented and accessible to
free software in the GNU system.  It seems that format was designed to
handle the sub-channel data that is the major flaw of the CUE sheet
format.  In fact it seems like a super-set of the CUE sheet format.
For that reason we would like to have a ccd2toc in complement of the
ccd2cue.  But is that another project?  If not, we have to change the
name. ;-)
