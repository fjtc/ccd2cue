This @inlinefmtifelse{html, page, file} contains a list of people that
made sufficiently large contributions to development that they can be
regarded as truly authors of the program.  This program would not be
what it is today without the invaluable help of these people, for whom
we would like to say:

@center @strong{THANK YOU VERY MUCH!}
@sp 1

The names are listed in chronological order of contribution.  Each
person's contact information, usually email, and a summary of that
person's contribution is put in per correspondent section.

For contributions that does not matter for copyright purposes, e.g.,
minor or non-source code contributions, see @inlinefmtifelse{html,
@url{THANKS.html, the thanks page}, file @file{THANKS}}.  If you would
appreciate your own name listed here, @strong{please contribute!}  See
@inlinefmtifelse{html, @url{README.html#Contributing, how to
contribute}, the ``Contributing'' section of the @file{README} file}.
